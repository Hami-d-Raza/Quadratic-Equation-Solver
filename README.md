# Quadratic Equation Solver

This project is a simple web-based quadratic equation solver implemented in JavaScript. It allows users to input the coefficients of a quadratic equation (a, b, c) and computes the real or complex solutions based on the discriminant.

<h2>Features</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Computes real solutions for quadratic equations with non-negative discriminants.</li>
  <li>Computes complex solutions (with imaginary parts) for quadratic equations with negative discriminants.</li>
  <li>Allows users to toggle between light and dark themes.</li>
  <li>Provides clear and formatted results.</li>
</ul>


<h2>Installation</h2>
